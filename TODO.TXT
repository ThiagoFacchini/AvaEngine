TODO 

- Make the canvas resizable ( based on tile width x tile height steps ) / draggable constrained by the main view ( no scroll )
- Add a canvas border to the canvasRenderer wrapper or resizable wrapper?
- render a map bigger than the screen based on a given position with a given buffer
- hover a particular map cell
- click a particular map cell
--------
think about window events: how resize interact with the canvas object
think about map mode ( play / edit )?
